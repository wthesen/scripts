    "This comprehensive assessment evaluates the Fort Saskatchewan Viking Formation for an innovative "
    "CO₂-cushion gas storage project. By injecting CO₂ to form a permanent cushion gas layer (20% of reservoir volume) "
    "and transitioning to natural gas storage operations, the project creates exceptional economic value while "
    "permanently sequestering carbon dioxide.\n\n"
    "Key findings from this comprehensive assessment include:\n\n"
    "• Strategic Location: The Fort Saskatchewan Viking Formation is ideally situated just 11 kilometers from Western Canada's "
    "largest concentration of CO₂ emitters, adjacent to the Wolf ACTL pipeline, and with access to ATCO natural gas infrastructure.\n\n"
    "• Reservoir Quality: The Viking Formation exhibits exceptional reservoir properties with 21% mean porosity, 500-2,000 mD "
    "permeability, and ~24m total thickness, supporting efficient CO₂ injection and gas storage operations.\n\n"  # Updated properties
    "• Innovative Approach: Using CO₂ as permanent cushion gas (20% of reservoir volume) eliminates the typical major expense "
    "of natural gas cushion gas while permanently sequestering CO₂.\n\n"
    "• Substantial Storage Value: With 80% of the original gas-in-place (355 Bcf) available as working gas capacity (284 Bcf), "
    "the estimated market value reaches C$1.40 billion based on comparable storage acquisition transactions.\n\n"
    "• Mixed Phase Regime: Temperature data (28-33°C) indicates the reservoir spans the CO₂ critical point (31.1°C), requiring "  # Added temperature info
    "specialized phase management for optimal operations.\n\n"
    "• Economic Model: The project transitions from initial CO₂ storage revenue to substantial natural gas storage revenue "
    "by 2030, with the potential for asset sale by 2035 at a valuation of ~C$1.4 billion.\n\n"
    "While the implementation requires careful management of the CO₂-CH₄ interface, the unique combination of reservoir "
    "properties, strategic location advantages, and innovative cushion gas approach creates an exceptional value proposition."

methodology_text = (
    "CO₂ storage capacity was estimated using the depleted gas reservoir method, standard for mature gas fields (see IPCC, 2005; "
    "Bachu et al., 2007). The calculation assumes that the pore space previously occupied by produced natural gas is available "
    "for CO₂ injection. The following steps outline the method:\n\n"
    
    "1. Total cumulative gas production obtained from reserves data: 300 Bcf (~8.5 billion m³).\n\n"
    
    "2. Theoretically, 1 scf of depleted methane pore space can hold 1.3–1.5 scf of CO₂ at typical depleted reservoir "
    "conditions (IPCC, 2005; NETL, 2015).\n\n"
    
    "3. CO₂ density at Viking Formation conditions (28-33°C, 400–800 psi) ranges from 600-900 kg/m³ depending on phase state. "  # Updated for phase variation
    "An average of 800 kg/m³ was used for this estimate based on liquid phase dominance in cooler areas.\n\n"  # Updated density
    
    "4. Storage efficiency is assumed to be 70–80% to account for sweep and operational factors (Bachu et al., 2007; NETL, 2015).\n\n"
    
    "5. Reservoir thickness is significantly greater (~24m) than previously documented (5.0m), enhancing storage capacity.\n\n"  # Added thickness note

    "   - Use a 1.4x ratio for CO₂: 300 Bcf × 1.4 = 420 Bcf (at reservoir conditions)\n\n"
    
    "C. Convert to tonnes using CO₂ density:\n"

interface_detail = (
    "Managing the CO₂-CH₄ interface is critical to the success of the cushion gas approach. This appendix provides "
    "additional technical detail on interface dynamics and management strategies.\n\n"
    
    "B.1 Physical Properties Governing Interface Behavior\n\n"
    
    "The CO₂-CH₄ interface is governed by several physical processes:\n\n"
    
    "1. Gravitational Segregation:\n"
    "   • CO₂ density at reservoir conditions (liquid phase): 800-900 kg/m³\n"  # Updated liquid phase
    "   • CO₂ density at reservoir conditions (supercritical phase): 600-700 kg/m³\n"  # Added supercritical phase
    "   • CH₄ density at reservoir conditions: 90-100 kg/m³\n"
    "   • Density contrast creates buoyancy forces that maintain segregation\n"
    "   • Segregation rate can be calculated using modified Darcy's law with density contrast\n\n"
    
    "2. Phase Behavior Across Critical Temperature:\n"  # Added phase behavior section
    "   • Viking reservoir temperature (28-33°C) spans CO₂ critical temperature (31.1°C)\n"
    "   • Liquid CO₂ (<31.1°C): Higher density, lower mobility, sharper interface\n"
    "   • Supercritical CO₂ (>31.1°C): Lower density, higher mobility, more diffuse interface\n"
    "   • Phase transitions possible during temperature fluctuations from operations\n"
    "   • Temperature management critical for interface stability\n\n"
    
    "3. Molecular Diffusion:\n"
    "   • Molecular diffusion coefficient for CO₂-CH₄ at reservoir conditions: ~1-5 × 10⁻⁸ m²/s\n"
    "   • Diffusion creates a mixing zone at the interface\n"
    "   • Mixing zone thickness increases with square root of time\n"
    "   • Typical mixing zone: 0.5-1.5 meters in liquid CO₂ zones, 1-2 meters in supercritical CO₂ zones\n\n"  # Updated mixing zone thickness
    
    "4. Dispersion During Flow:\n"
    "   • Mechanical dispersion during withdrawal/injection cycles\n"
    "   • Dispersion coefficient typically 10-100× molecular diffusion\n"
    "   • Primary mechanism for interface thickening during operations\n"
    "   • Can be controlled through operational practices\n\n"
    
    "5. Convective Mixing:\n"
    "   • Temperature differences can create convective cells\n"
    "   • Minimal in horizontal reservoirs with stable temperature\n"
    "   • More significant with thermal gradients or during injection\n"
    "   • Managed through temperature control of injected gas\n\n"
    
    "B.2 Operational Strategies for Interface Management\n\n"
    
    "Operational strategies to manage the interface include:\n\n"
    
    "1. Temperature-Based Zonation Strategy:\n"  # Added temperature zonation
    "   • Map temperature distribution across reservoir (28-33°C)\n"
    "   • Identify liquid CO₂ zones (<31.1°C): Optimize for sharper interface\n"
    "   • Identify supercritical CO₂ zones (>31.1°C): Implement enhanced monitoring\n"
    "   • Create buffer zones around 31.1°C isotherm to manage phase transitions\n"
    "   • Develop zone-specific operating protocols\n\n"
    
    "2. Vertical Separation Strategy:\n"
    "   • CO₂ injection in lower 25% of net pay\n"
    "   • CH₄ production from upper 25% of net pay\n"
    "   • Minimum 5-7m vertical separation between perforation intervals\n"
    "   • Monitoring well perforations positioned at anticipated interface\n\n"
    
    "3. Pressure Management Protocol:\n"
    "   • Minimum operating pressure: 6 MPa (870 psi)\n"
    "   • Maximum withdrawal rate: 3-5% pressure decline per day\n"
    "   • Pressure recovery periods between major withdrawals\n"
    "   • Minimum 48-hour stabilization after major pressure changes\n\n"
    
    "4. Buffer Zone Approach:\n"
    "   • 10-15% of reservoir volume as mixed-gas buffer zone\n"
    "   • Accept CO₂ concentrations of 2-20% in buffer zone\n"
    "   • Periodically refresh buffer zone through selective production\n"
    "   • Monitor compositional changes within buffer zone\n\n"
    
    "5. Advanced Monitoring System:\n"  # Updated monitoring system
    "   • Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) for interface and phase tracking\n"
    "   • Continuous gas composition monitoring at wellheads\n"
    "   • Automated alerts for CO₂ breakthrough and temperature shifts\n"
    "   • Pre-defined response protocols for contamination events\n"
    "   • Pulsed neutron logging to track fluid saturation changes\n"
    "   • Time-lapse seismic to visualize CO₂ plume\n\n"
    
    "These technical approaches have been validated in laboratory studies and limited field applications. "
    "The Fort Saskatchewan Viking project will implement comprehensive monitoring and adaptive management "
    "to ensure effective interface control throughout the project lifecycle."
