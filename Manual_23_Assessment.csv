Internal Holistic License Assessment,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The holistic license assessment includes multiple factors. The Licensee Capability Assessment (the ""LCA""  is a critical one. Additional factors are described in section 4.5 of Directive 067: Eligibility Requirements for Acquiring and Holding Energy Licences and Approvals, and the AER may consider any other factors or information that would be appropriate in the circumstance. These factors include other inspection, audit, or compliance elements not included in the LCA and information provided to the AER through complaints and other licensee submissions and reporting. ",,,,,,,,
Manual 023 - Clause 2.1 Licensee Capability Assessment,,,,,,,,
"Th LCA uses various factors to identify the risks posed by a licensee. Table 1 groups these factors into two groups, risk and performance, and ties them to terms used in the LCA as follows:",,,,,,,,

Manual 023 - Clause 2.1.2 Performance Group,,,,,,,,
"At the factor level, a licensee’s performance is assessed relative to licensees with similar business type, size, and production portfolio—referred to as peer groups (section 2.1.2.1). The peer groups, along with a weighting for each parameter and a tier methodology (section 2.1.2.2), are used to assess the individual parameters within a performance group and for the LCA factor itself.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The tables below show the parameters used to assess the Company and compare it to it's peers in its' designated Performance Group as designated by  the AER.  As the Company is a new operator all of the information required to make these assessments are not currently available.  The Company will track the parameters below on an ongoing basis to ensure that it is falling within the lowest risk Tier where possible,,,,,,,,

Manual 023 - Clause 6.1.2 Transfer Security,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"A transfer application will trigger a holistic assessment of the transferor and transferee, considering their current and post-transfer situations. This includes the licences transferred as well as those remaining with the licensee. Section 5.2 indicates when further scrutiny of the application is required, which may result in security as a condition of approval. Security deposits may be requested from either or both transferor and transferee.",,,,,,,,
"Table 9 and table 10 are provided to give transferors and transferees a sense of what security may be required, but the AER retains its discretion to determine the appropriate amount considering the specific risks and circumstances of the application. Table 9 is for “producer” licensees only, and table 10 is for “midstream, pipelines, and waste management” licensees (defined above in section 2.1.2.1).",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Taking into account the Company's assessment of low future financial risk per above and the assumption (per McDaniel's evaluation) of the Crossover Timeline being 'Very Far' or over 15 years (per Table 9 classifications) and in addition, that the AER has in the past given start-up companies with little or no financial or operating history a period of 18-24 months before assessing whether or not a security deposit will be required, it would be reasonable to assume that no or minimal security deposit will be required on transfer of the licenses to Cascade or in the future.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Manual 023 - Clause 6.1.3 Refund of Security Deposits,,,,,,,,
"Section 6 of Directive 068 outlines the requirements for the refund of security deposits, including that a licensee must be compliant with all AER requirements to be eligible. Specifically, when a refund request is made for security collected under Directive 088, a holistic assessment of the licensee requesting the security refund will be triggered.",,,,,,,,
"Depending on the crossover timeline and level of financial distress, we will determine what percentage of the licensee’s entire inactive and marginal estimated liability must be retained by the AER. Table 11 and table 12 are provided to give licensees a sense of the thresholds, but the AER retains its discretion to determine the appropriate security refund amount considering the specific risks and circumstances of the licensee. Table 11 is for “producer” licensees only, and table 12 is for “midstream, pipelines, and waste management” licensees (defined above in section 2.1.2.1).",,,,,,,,

Taking into account the Company's assessment of future financial risk per above and the assumption (per McDaniel's evaluation) of the Crossover Timeline being 'Very Far' or over 15 years it would be reasonable to assume that if a security deposit was required on transfer of the licenses to Cascade the Company could expect to receive a refund of substantially of all if any deposit put up on initial transfer of the licenses within 2 years of operations,,,,,,,,
