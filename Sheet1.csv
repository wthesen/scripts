Pipelines,,
"15. Depending on its use, a pipeline may be included in Class 1, 8, 41 or 49, as the case may be. A pipeline acquired by a taxpayer that is not",,
"(a) gas or oil well equipment – Class 41 (see ¶s 3-4),",,
"(b) Canadian field processing equipment – Class 41 (see ¶ 6),",,
"(c) a new pipeline acquired after February 22, 2005 used for the transmission of petroleum, natural gas or related hydrocarbons – Class 49 (see ¶ 17), or",,
"(d) a pipeline for which the CRA, in consultation with the Minister of Natural Resources, is satisfied that the main source of supply is likely to be exhausted within 15 years of it becoming operational – Class 8 by virtue of paragraph (i) thereof",,
will be included in Class 1 by virtue of paragraph (l) thereof.,,
"Note: The 2007 Federal Budget proposes that a new pipeline, including control and monitoring devices, valves and other equipment ancillary to the pipeline, used for the distribution (but not the transmission) of natural gas that is acquired after March 18, 2007 be included in new Class 51 which will have a CCA rate of 6 per cent on a declining balance basis. The 2008 Federal Budget proposes that a new pipeline used for the transmission of carbon dioxide that is acquired after February 25, 2008 be included in Class 49.",,
16. Examples of pipelines included in paragraph (l) of Class 1 are as follows:,,
"pipelines (other than new pipelines eligible for Class 49 – see ¶ 17 ) used for the transmission of petroleum, natural gas or related hydrocarbons;",,
"pipelines used to transmit oil from the primary separator to the transmission line or to an oil processing plant (i.e., refinery);",,
"in the case of heavy crude oil, a pipeline used to transport condensate to the field blending facilities;",,
pipelines from the primary separator in a gas field to the transmission line (other than a pipeline used solely to transmit natural gas to a natural gas processing plant – see ¶s 3 and 4);,,
pipelines from a gas processing plant to the transmission line;,,
a water supply pipeline from a river or any other source to a gas processing plant;,,
pipelines (other than new pipelines eligible for Class 49 – see ¶ 17 ) used to transmit natural gas to a straddle plant. Such pipelines are considered to be used primarily for transmitting the gas to market;,,
product sales lines from a gas processing plant to loading facilities or a transmission line;,,
liquefied petroleum gas and ethane pipelines from a gas processing plant to storage facilities; and,,
"pipelines used for the distribution of petroleum, natural gas or related hydrocarbons. [See note at the end of paragraph 15].",,
"Attachments to a pipeline that are considered to be an integral and component part of a pipeline (e.g., valves, control devices, branches, extensions, racks) will be included in the same CCA class as the pipeline of which they are a part.",,
"For comments concerning linefill in a pipeline and the capital cost of a pipeline, see the current version of IT-482, Pipelines.",,
"17. Class 49 includes property acquired after February 22, 2005 that is a pipeline, including control and monitoring devices, valves and other equipment ancillary to the pipeline, used for the transmission (but not the distribution) of petroleum, natural gas or related hydrocarbons. This is a functional determination as to whether a pipeline is used for the transmission of a product. Therefore, for example, a pipeline used in the transmission phase of a company’s business that consists primarily of the distribution of gas, may qualify for inclusion in Class 49. Similarly, a pipeline used to transmit natural gas to a straddle plant may be included in this class.",,
"However, only property that has not been used or acquired for use for any purpose by any taxpayer before February 23, 2005 is eligible to be included in Class 49. Eligible property does not include",,
"pipelines described in ¶ 15(d) above,",,
"a building or structure, or",,
pipeline appendages (see ¶s 18 to 24).,,
"A separate class election, which must be made for the taxation year in which the property is acquired, is available under subsection 1101(5v) of the Regulations for Class 49 property. Although this separate class election does not change the CCA rate for such property, it does provide that any terminal loss or recapture will be realized at the time of disposition.",,
"As indicated in the Note at the end of ¶ 15, it is proposed that a new pipeline used for the transmission of carbon dioxide that is acquired after February 25, 2008 be included in Class 49.",,
Pipeline Appendages,,
"18. Where an attachment to a pipeline is not an integral and component part of the pipeline, it is considered to be separate equipment from that of the pipeline (a “pipeline appendage”). For further information and examples, see the current version of IT-482.",,
"19. Except as noted in ¶ 24(a), where a pipeline is included in Class 41 (see ¶ 15(a) and (b)), any appendage to it will also be included in that class.",,
20. A pipeline appendage acquired by a taxpayer that is not included in Class 41 as described in ¶ 19 will be included in,,
"Class 7 by virtue of paragraph (j) thereof, if it is pumping, compression or any ancillary equipment acquired after February 22, 2005 related to a transmission pipeline for petroleum, natural gas or related hydrocarbons (see ¶ 21);",,
"Class 8 by virtue of paragraph (i) thereof, if it is a compressor station acquired before February 23, 2005 that is used",,
,,
"(a) for the transmission of natural gas from a gas field or gas plant to a transmission pipeline, or",,
"(b) in conjunction with a transmission pipeline,",,
but is not used in conjunction with the distribution of natural gas (see ¶ 22);,,
"Class 8 by virtue of paragraph (i) thereof, if it is used for the transmission or distribution of crude oil and it is not included in paragraph (j) of Class 7; or",,
"Class 1 by virtue of paragraph (n) thereof, if it is acquired primarily for the distribution of natural gas and it is not included in paragraph (j) of Class 7 (see ¶s 21 to 24).",,
"Note: The 2008 Federal Budget proposes that any pumping, compression or ancillary equipment acquired after February 25, 2008 that is on a carbon dioxide transmission pipeline be included in Class 7.",,
"21. Paragraph(j) of Class 7 includes pumping and compressing equipment that pumps or compresses petroleum, natural gas or related hydrocarbons for the purpose of moving it",,
"through a transmission pipeline,",,
"from a transmission pipeline to a storage facility, or",,
to a transmission line from a storage facility.,,
"This class will include certain property acquired after February 22, 2005 that would have previously been included in Class 1 by virtue of paragraph (n) thereof (see ¶ 24) since property described in Class 1 is included in that class only if it is not included in any other class (such as Class 7).",,
"A separate class election, which must be made for the taxation year in which the property is acquired, is available under subsection 1101(5u) of the Regulations for property included in Class 7 by virtue of paragraph (j) thereof. Although this separate class election does not change the CCA rate for such property, it does provide that any remaining balance of undepreciated capital cost in the class after the disposition of the property, can in the year of disposition, be fully deducted as a terminal loss.",,
"22. Paragraph 8 of archived Interpretation Bulletin IT‑482, Capital Cost Allowance – Pipelines, dated November 1, 1981, indicated that:",,
"“A compressor station that is used in the transmission of natural gas from a gas field or a gas plant to a transmission pipeline, or that is used in conjunction with a main transmission pipeline, is included in Class 8. A compressor station that is used in conjunction with the distribution of gas is included in class 2 by virtue of paragraph (d) thereof [now paragraph (n) of Class 1].”",,
"This bulletin was issued before the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) decisions in Northern and Central Gas Corporation v. The Queen,87 DTC 5439, [1987] 2 CTC 241 and Pacific Northern Gas Limited v. The Queen, 91 DTC 5287, [1991] 1 CTC 469 (see ¶ 23). Prior to the FCA’s decision in Northern and Central Gas Corporation, a Special Release to IT-482 dated February 28, 1986 was issued which indicated that the position in ¶ 8 of the bulletin would continue to be followed pending the outcome of the appeal of the case. However, for a number of reasons, the bulletin was not revised once that decision was released. Therefore, notwithstanding the view expressed in ¶ 23,the CRA will maintain the position in ¶ 8 of IT-482 that compressor stations used in the transmission of natural gas or in conjunction with a transmission pipeline acquired before February 23, 2005 will be included in Class 8. Such compressor stations acquired after February 22, 2005 will be included in Class 7 by virtue of paragraph (j) thereof (see ¶s 20 and 21).",,
"In interpreting the words in the second sentence in ¶ 8 of IT‑482, “A compressor station that is used in conjunction with the distribution of gas…”, the CRA has generally adopted a “main purpose approach” rather than a functional approach to the classification of natural gas pipeline compressors. For example, compressors that form part of a taxpayer’s transmission system that is used primarily in the taxpayer’s business of distributing natural gas would be included in paragraph (n) of Class 1 and not in Class 8. Distribution of natural gas includes deliveries to the ultimate consumers, regardless of whether they are residential, commercial or industrial and whether or not the taxpayer is the owner of the natural gas being distributed.",,
"23. Paragraph (n) of Class 1 generally includes property that is manufacturing and distributing equipment and plant (including structures) acquired primarily for the production or distribution of gas. Based on the decisions of the courts in Northern and Central Gas and Pacific Northern Gas Limited, it is the CRA’s view that the words “distributing equipment and plant” and “distribution of gas” as used in paragraph (n) of Class 1 should be interpreted in a broad and general sense and should not be given the more restrictive meaning used by the natural gas industry to distinguish between a natural gas transmission system and a natural gas distribution system.",,
24. Examples of pipeline appendages that would generally be included in Class 1 by virtue of paragraph (n) thereof are as follows:,,
(a) pipeline appendages attached to a pipeline used solely for transmitting gas to a natural gas processing plant (Note: they do not qualify as gas or oil well equipment);,,
"(b) compressors acquired before February 23, 2005 that are used primarily in the taxpayer’s business of distributing natural gas (see ¶s 22 and 23); and",,
"(c) liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and related storage facilities (other than designated underground storage costs). (See the decision in Northern and Central Gas Corporation.) LNG facilities include facilities which liquefy the natural gas prior to shipment, those which regasify it after transport and those that liquefy natural gas for storage during periods of low demand and regasify it for use during periods of high demand.",,
"However, where the pipeline appendages referred to in paragraphs a) and b) above are pumping, compression and any ancillary equipment related to a transmission pipeline for natural gas acquired after February 22, 2005, they will be included in Class 7 by virtue of paragraph (j) thereof (see ¶ 21).",,
"Note: The 2007 Federal Budget proposes that eligible equipment acquired after March 18, 2007 that is part of an LNG facility that liquefies or regasifies natural gas be included in Class 47, which has a CCA rate of 8 per cent. Eligible equipment will include controls, cooling equipment, compressors, pumps, storage tanks, vaporizers and ancillary equipment, loading and unloading pipelines on the facility site used to transport the LNG between a ship and the facility and related structures; but will not include a building, breakwater, dock, jetty, wharf or similar structure, or property acquired for the purpose of producing oxygen or nitrogen.",,
Other CCA Classes,,
"25. Generally, buildings or other structures are included in Class 1. However, certain buildings that have no footings or any other base support below ground level are included in Class 6. In addition, as noted in ¶ 11, buildings or other structures may qualify for inclusion in subparagraph (b)(i) of Class 41 because they are described in paragraph (g) of Class 10. For further information, see the current version of IT-79, Capital Cost Allowance – Buildings or Other Structures.",,
"26. Depreciable property (such as a service rig) used in the completion, re-completion or work-over of an oil or gas well will generally be included in either paragraph (a) of Class 10 or paragraph (i) of Class 8. Generally, automotive service rigs are included in Class 10 by virtue of paragraph (a) thereof and non-automotive service rigs are in Class 8 by virtue of paragraph (i) thereof. For a discussion of CCA in respect of offshore drilling rigs, see the current version of IT‑267, Capital Cost Allowance – Vessels.",,
"27. Pursuant to paragraph 13(7.5)(b) of the Act and subsection 1102(14.3) of the Regulations, where a taxpayer has incurred costs on account of capital for the building of or right to use roads, parking areas, storage areas or similar surface construction and the amount of these costs would not otherwise be included in the capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property, the taxpayer is considered to have acquired a depreciable property having a capital cost equal to the amount of such costs. The capital cost of such property would be included in the undepreciated capital cost of property of Class 17 by virtue of paragraph (c) thereof.",,
Schedules,,
"28. The schedules appended to this bulletin indicate the appropriate CCA classification of certain equipment used in P and NG activities, as well as certain expenditures that qualify as either Canadian exploration expense (“CEE”) (as defined in subsection 66.1(6)) or Canadian development expense (“CDE”) (as defined in subsection 66.2(5)). In addition to Class 41 assets, the schedules also describe some of the assets that are included in Classes 1, 6, 7, 8, 17, 43 and 49. Since the classification of certain assets used in bituminous sands projects is described in ¶s 10-14, they are not included in the schedules.",,
Exclusions from Depreciable Property,,
"29. A “specified temporary access road” (as defined in subsection 1104(2) of the Regulations) is generally a road built for temporary access to an oil or gas well in Canada in the course of drilling or completing such well. It is excluded from Class 17 by virtue of paragraph (c) thereof and excluded from Class 8 by virtue of subparagraph (i)(vi) thereof. Since it is not depreciable property of a prescribed class, the cost of a specified temporary access road may qualify as CEE or CDE provided that other requirements of those provisions are met.",,
"30. An “oil or gas well” (as defined in subsection 248(1)), including well casing and cementing, is not considered to be “gas or oil well equipment” and it is also excluded from Class 8 by virtue of subparagraph (i)(iv) thereof. An oil or gas well in Canada is a “Canadian resource property” (as defined in subsection 66(15)), the cost of which qualifies as “Canadian oil and gas property expense” (as defined in subsection 66.4(5)).",,
Depreciable Property Excluded from CEE and CDE,,
"31. Pursuant to paragraph (k.1) of the definition of CEE in subsection 66.1(6) and paragraph (i.1) of the definition of CDE in subsection 66.2(5), the CEE and CDE of a taxpayer do not include an expense that is a cost, or any part of the cost, to the taxpayer of any depreciable property of a prescribed class that was acquired after 1987. Other provisions dealing with the treatment of depreciable property vs. resource expenses (e.g., CEE and CDE) are",,
"for taxation years that end after 1987 and before December 6, 1996 — subsection 13(34), and",,
"for taxation years that end after December 5, 1996 — paragraph 1102(1)(a) of the Regulations and paragraph (l) of the definition of CEE in subsection 66.1(6) and paragraph (j) of the definition of CDE in subsection 66.2(5) of the Act.",,
Calculation of CCA,,
"32. CCA for equipment used in P and NG activities may be claimed under paragraph 20(1)(a). The maximum annual rate of CCA for Class 41 property is 25% applied to the undepreciated capital cost of the class. The CCA rates for the other classes are indicated in brackets beside the name of the class in the appended schedules. As indicated in ¶s 12-13, property acquired to be used in a new bituminous sands project or in a major or a minor expansion to an existing bituminous sands project may qualify for additional CCA.",,
"33. The maximum annual CCA claim (other than the additional CCA described in ¶ 13) is subject to the “50% rule” for property acquired in a year, or that became available for use in a year. No amount in respect of the cost of depreciable property may be included in calculating a taxpayer’s undepreciated capital cost of property of a prescribed class before the property is considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer. For more information concerning the available for use rules and the “50% rule”, refer to subsections 13(26) to (31) and the current version of IT- 285, Capital Cost Allowance – General Comments.",,
"Paragraph 1100(2.21)(a) of the Regulations provides that where a taxpayer is deemed to have disposed of and acquired or reacquired a property, for purposes of certain CCA provisions including subsection 1102(14) of the Regulations (see below), the acquisition or reacquisition will be deemed to have been from a person with whom the taxpayer does not deal at arm’s length. Therefore, the “50% rule” will not apply upon the deemed acquisition or reacquisition of the property.",,
"34. When a taxpayer disposes of a property of a prescribed class in a taxation year and before the end of that year acquires another property of another prescribed class, the taxpayer may be able to elect to transfer the former property from the former class to the present class of the new property if the requirements of subsection 1103(2d) of the Regulations are met. For further information, refer to the current version of IT-472, Capital Cost Allowance—Class 8 Property.",,
"35. When a taxpayer acquires a property in the course of a qualifying butterfly reorganization described in paragraph 55(3)(b) or from a non-arm’s length party, subsection 1102(14) of the Regulations generally requires the taxpayer to place the property in the same prescribed class or separate prescribed class as that of the person from whom it was acquired. See the current version of IT-147, Capital Cost Allowance— Accelerated Write-off of Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Equipment for a discussion of this provision.",,
